# Python Challange

This project will analyse two datasets using python. 
The main reason is to read csv files and write txt files using python. And we will go analyse the data to get the answers for the following questions:

First data set:

-The total number of months included in the dataset

-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Second data set: 

-The total number of votes cast

-A complete list of candidates who received votes

-The percentage of votes each candidate won

-The total number of votes each candidate won

-The winner of the election based on popular vote
